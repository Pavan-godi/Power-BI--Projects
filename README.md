#Power BI Projects

This is my repository containig all of my power bi dashboards and their relative dataset attched here.
you can download my dashboard file of having the extemsion .pbix and the data set will be attached so that you can download dataset as well.

These are the tasks that i came across while doing Forage certification on PWC 

TASK-1:
Creating  a dashboard in Power BI for Claire that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics in the dataset. Get creative! 

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

-Overall customer satisfaction
-Overall calls answered/abandoned
-Calls by time
-Average speed of answer
-Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered


Task-2:
Create a dashboard for the information provided below.
-Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
-The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination 
-Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk 
-We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
-We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management
